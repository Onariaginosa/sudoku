Note: Group Numbers are labelled within each group block
		Group Blocks are separated with double dashes and a space

Check for possibilities
Create a possibility map

Solving Strategies: 

	1. Instant Value Finder:
		For spots with one possibility that is the value
	2. Only 1 option
		For groups, rows and columns where a number appears in only one position
		in said group/row/column in the possibility map, that number is the value;
	3. The x-y split:
		For values where 2 numbers can only be in one box, and the same for another position
		then those two numbers are removed from their given group/row/column
		
	4. The group row/column assumption:
		If an x-y split occurs where the 2 positions are in one row or one column, of a group
		then it can be assumed in the solve for numbers instance that the two numbers (x and y)
		are only in that row/column for that group in Number Solving.
		
	5. Number Solving:
		In a row of 3 groups or a column of 3 groups this is applicable. There can be one of each
		number in a group and a row/column. Therefore, if a number, x is in group 1 in the middle
		column, and group 4 in the  left column, then a 1 in group 7 can only appear in the right 
		column. The same rule applies with rows.
