This is a Sudoku Puzzle Game solver and maker that I'm making for fun.

# How to use it
Currently the solving functionality is being developed, and is not completely functional. 
However, in the SudokuGame class you can create a Sudoku Game and see if it is a valid game,
meaning you can test to see if you have made any errors so far in solving your Sudoku puzzle.
A tutorial on how to do so will come soon.
